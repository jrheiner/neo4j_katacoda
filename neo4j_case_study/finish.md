## Thank you for completing this scenario about Neo4j.

Here is a quick summary of what you learned in this scenario:
- How to design a graph data model based on existing data
- How to import data from a CSV file using the Neo4j Cypher Shell
- How to perform graph database queries
- How to use graph database relations and graph algorithms as a movie recommendation engine

Below you can find a list of all sources, references, and literature. This is also a great starting point to further explore graph databases, Neo4j, or the Cypher Query Language.
