Thank you for completing this scenario about Neo4j.

Here is a quick summary of what you learned in this scenario:
- How to design a graph data model based on existing data
- How to import data from a CSV file using the Neo4j Cypher Shell
- How to perform graph database queries
- How to use graph database relations as a simple movie recommendation engine
